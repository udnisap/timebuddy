# Timebuddy
Chrome extension to convert time on pages. Simple select a time on the page and convert it to your local time.

# How it works
1. Basically you need a starting timezone and a target timezone. Both defaults to the browser timezone.

2. Now right click and time on the page and simply click convert. It will convert based on the conversion setup.

Alternatively you can set the source timezone as well as the target timezone when the text is selected.
